[["index.html", "NCAA Mens Basketball Chapter 1 Introduction", " NCAA Mens Basketball Samuel Fields, Rohan Poddar 2023-04-17 Chapter 1 Introduction In this project, we intend to perform a general data visualization analysis of the 2021-2022 NCAA D1 Mens basketball league. We chose this topic because we are both fans of college basketball and are we interested in learning more behind the statistics of college basketball and the perspective it can provide us beyond casual fandom. For those unfamiliar with the sport, basketball is a 5 on 5 team sport that can commonly be broken down into the following manner. Each player has three possible positions he might be categorized under - guard, forward, or center. This categorization might be determined due to the player’s skillset and / or natural features (ie height). The game can also be understood under two contexts, offense and defense, where offense refers to a teams effort to score (attain) points and defense refers to a teams effort to prevent the opposing team from scoring (attaining) points. Both offense and defense efforts can be understood by certain statistics which we will explore in our project. Topics were are interested in analyzing in this project include: how we might understand individual player’s offensive and / or defensive efficiency in basketball? how might we understand a team’s offensive and / or defensive efficiency and how might this relate to a teams ability to win basketball games? "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In our final project, we will perform a rigorous data visualization analysis for the various counting statistics available from the 2021-2022 NCAA men’s basketball season. Such an analysis will seek to make sense of win-loss ratios by finding patterns across offensive and defensive analytics, which might show team advantages provided by individually exceptional players or perhaps by a more rounded team contribution. Furthermore, an analysis of this data might make sense of differences of competition across school divisions by analyzing differences in player and team skill level. 2.2 Data availability The statistics page of the NCAA (https://stats.ncaa.org/) allows for a very in depth search of individual players and individual teams by introducing a large number of search fields. For example, through the website interface, we can input search fields for “Men’s Basketball” “2021-2022” and “Final Statistics” to start an initial search for the statistics of interest for this project. We can then enter the “Individual” tab to start a search for individual player statistics, and then enter a search field for a basketball statistic of choice. For example, we might enter “3-pt Field Goal Attempts” which will then populate a table below that retrieves the player name, school, school division, player class level, height, basketball position they play, the number of 3-pt Field Goals the player attempted, and the rank of the player by the number of 3-pt Field Goals the player attempted (highest to lowest). This table also provides a button to download an excel file of the table return of this search. Other individual search categories include “Assists per Game” (assists are a pass of the basketball to another player that results in a score by the passed-to player), “Points per Game”, “Blocked Shots per Game”, and 24 other counted statics of relevance. If we choose to enter the “Team” tab rather than the “Individual” tab to start searches for team statics, not only can we search for aggregates of some of the individual player statistics by team, but there are also 5 other statistics available, such as “Win-Loss Margin” or “Turn Over Margin” that are game based statics aggregated across the whole teams roster. Our plan is to individually click through and download every individual statistic and every team statistic create two different aggregate datasets. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning &amp; Transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources Our data was sourced from the NCAA Statistics National Ranking website (https://stats.ncaa.org/rankings). This website provides public access to statistics across a variety of NCAA sports and divisions. The NCAA Statistics website provides a user interface that allows the user to select the statistic of interest, and download the data related to it. For our project, we focused on NCAA Division I Men’s basketball conference. We use two kinds of data - Team Statistics and Individual Player Statistics. 3.1.1 Team statistics The data is available for 350 of the 358 teams in the conference for the 2021-22 season. The 8 teams that do not feature in the data are the ones being transitioned from lower divisions to division I. The team statistics list includes columns on the school’s name (which also includes information about the school’s regional division), number of games played, number of games won and number of games lost. The team statistics we collected from the website were Blocks, Fouls, Field Goals Made, Field Goals Attempted, Field Goal Percentage, Opponent’s Field Goals Made, Opponent’s Field Goals Attempted, Opponent’s Field Goal Percentage, Free-throws, Free-throws attempted, Free-throw percentage, Total Rebounds, Offensive Rebounds, Defensive Rebounds, Opponent’s Rebounds, Rebound Margin, Points, Opponent’s Points, Scoring Margin, Points Per Game, Steals, Three-Point Field Goals Made, Three-Point Field Goals Attempted, Three-Point Field Goal Percentage, Opponent’s Three-Point Field Goals Made, Opponent’s Three-Point Field Goals Attempted, Assists, Turnovers, Opponent’s Turnovers. In total, we collected 30 team statistics. 3.1.2 Individual Player Statistics For the players, each statistic is limited to the top 350 players belonging to a specific statistical ranking. In addition to the player statistic of interest, each top 350 player statistics list includes columns on the player’s name (which also includes information about their school’s regional conference), their class level (freshman, sophomore, etc), their height, their basketball position (Guard, Forward, or Center), and the number of games they played. The player statistics we collected from the website were 3-Point Field Goal Attempts, Assist Turnover Ratio, Assists per Game, Blocked Shots per Game, Defensive Rebounds per Game, Double Doubles, Field-Goal Percentage, Free-Throw Attempts, Free-Throws Made, Free-Throw Percentage, Minutes per Game, Offensive Rebounds per Game, Points per Game, Rebounds per Game, Steals per Game, Three-Point Field Goals per Game, Three-Point Field Goal Percentage, Total Three-Point Field Goals Made, Total Assists, Total Blocks, Total Field Goal Attempts, Total Field Goals Made, Total Minutes, Total Points, Total Rebounds, Total Steals, and Total Triple Doubles. In total, we collected 27 player statistics. 3.2 Cleaning &amp; Transformation The different statistics for Team and Players were available in separate excel files that had to be combined into 1 master dataframe for Team Statistics and 1 for Individual Player Statistics. The individual player information (player name, height, class level, position, and games played) and team information (school name, games played, and win-loss ratio) were used to merge the different excel files since these fields were common to all. Following this, the team’s regional division was mined and added as a feature in the dataset for both the players and the teams. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Team Statistics Dataset We can observe from the plot above that we have no missing team statistics. This is due to uniformity in maintaining team stats across all teams in the division. 3.3.2 Player Statistics Dataset We can observe from the plot above that the only complete features in this data set are the Player’s name (Player), Class level (Cl), Height (Ht), Basketball Position (Pos), Number of games played (G), and their school’s divisional conference (Division). Beyond this, we can then observe that the remaining data features are each, roughly, 76% missing. From this observation, we can infer that the top 350 individual players from each statistical list we pulled are mostly mutually exclusive. The majority of students do not rank in the top 350 players across more than one top 350 statistical list ranking that we collected. We can see this broken down in the following visualization. The visualization above depicts the count of the top 40 most frequent intersecting missing value features, with a max intersection of at most 10 missing features. These numbers were chosen for visualization quality. On the far left, we can observe that the most frequent intersection of missing values (with a max intersection of at most 10 features) is samples with both Free Throw Attempts (FTA), Free Throws Made (FT), Minutes Played (MP), Field Goals Attempted (FGA), Minutes Per Game(MPG), Turn Overs (TO), Assist to Turnover Ration (Ratio), Field Goals Made (FG), 3 Point Field Goal Percentage (X3FG), and Number of Triple Doubles (Trpl.Dbl). This set of intersecting missing values accounted for 635 samples with missing values. We can then observe a steep drop off for the rest of the intersecting missing value sets, but there is a persistent trend that the large majority of samples that contain a missing value contain a missing value across more than one, and even two, data features. This supports the hypothesis that the large majority of individual players do rank in top 350 players for multiple top 350 player statistic lists. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 General Analysis 4.2 Defensive Analysis 4.3 Offensive Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 General Analysis We will first start with a general analysis of the distribution of our dataset. We can first observe the uneven distribution of teams across the different regional conferences in the NCAA D1 Mens basketball league. For reference, a conference is a regional subdivision of the overall NCAA league, wherein multiple teams in similar regions will belong in the same conference. Teams will compete most often with other teams in their conference, but this is not always the case. Due to the history of NCAA D1 Mens basketball and how it affects player recruitment, some divisions are considered more competitive (for example the Big 12 conference) and others are considered less so (such as the Ivy League conference). This is something we will seek to quantify below. In the graph above, we have displayed the average number of games Won, Lost, and Played by each team by conference. We have also sorted the conferences in this graph by the average number of games Won by each team by conference. Due to the nature of team playing schedules, where there is a fair amount of competition crossover by conference (meaning teams will play other teams outside their respective conferences), we would hypothesize that, if the conferences are not equal in skill level, because of this schedule crossover, conferences with higher skilled teams should have a higher average number of team wins than conferences with lower skilled teams. Observing the graph above, we can observe this hypothesis to be supported. The conference that is conventionally considered to be the most skilled, the Big 12, is definitively at the top of our graph, suggesting that teams belonging to the Big 12 conference have on average the most number of games won, and the Ivy League, a conventionally poorly skilled conference, sits near the bottom. Our next general analysis will focus on the general distribution of the player data by its categorical variables: player class level (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) and player position (Guard, Forward, or Center). We can first observe that Guards (G) are represented the most in our player statistics data set and centers (C) are represented the least. Furthermore, Seniors (Sr.) are the most represented class level and Freshmen (Fr.) are the least represented. Since our player data is incomplete, we only had access to the top 350 ranked players per each player data statistic we downloaded rather than ever player, we can make no comment as to whether or not certain positions or class levels are over or under represented in our data set. Rather, we should keep this overall distribution in mind as we conduct our later analysis. 4.2 Defensive Analysis We defined “Defensive Statistics” to include Rebounds, Rebounds per Game, Steals, Steals per Game, Blocks, and Blocks per Game. However, since the total number of games played by each team / player is not consistent, this has the possible to skew total valued statistics in favor of teams / players that played a higher number of total games. For this reason, the majority of this analysis will focus on the “per Game” statistics since these are all normalized by the total number of games each team / player played. 4.2.1 Player Defensive Analysis The Player Defensive Analysis focuses on the Players’ defensive efficiency by their average time played, compared by their class level (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) and their Player Position (Guard, Forward, or Center). In particular, we focus our analysis on “efficient outliers” in each respective defensive category as well as overall trends in each category by class level or position. We will first observe the overall distribution of our data from the perspective of Player Class Level and Position. We can observe that the representation of the data when observed from the perspective of Player Class Level and Position resembles a right-skewed normal distribution. Some of the sub portions are also bi-modal or tri-modal. We can also observe that there are no “Center” Player Positions represented in the Steals per Game subsection of the dataset. We will next analyze the players defensive efficiency by Class Level. The players that we deem the most “efficient” should have a high defensive statistic per less average time played. Thus, those players who tend towards the top of each scatter plot (since the x-axis starts at 32 Minutes) would be deemed more “efficient.” Looking at the Rebounds per Game vs Minutes per Game plot, the obvious outliers that stand out are Fardaws Aimaq (Sophomore) at 10.59 Rebounds per Game and 34.3 Minutes per Game and Dillon Jones (Freshman) at 9.06 Rebounds per Game and 33.93 Minutes per Game. It is interesting to observe that both of these players are underclassmen despite the fact that the majority of the players in this plot (ie the top 350 ranked Rebounds per Game players) are Juniors or Seniors. Looking at the Steals per Game vs Minutes per Game plot, the outliers that stand out the most are Nendah Tarke (Sophomore) at 2.94 Steals per Game per 34.1 Minutes per Game and Jacob Gilyard (Senior) at 2.92 steals per game and 38.6 Minutes per game. Looking at the Blocks per Game vs Minutes per Game plot, efficient players that stand out include E.J. Liddell (Junior) at 2.59 Blocks per game and 33.15 Minutes per Game and Zach Austin (Sophomore) at 2.16 Blocks per Game and 34.6 Minutes per Game. Across the outliers, there seems to be no apparent trend or pattern in an analysis by class level. However, when observing the overall participants of the graphs (ie the top ranked players per each defensive category) there does seem to be an over representation of upper classmen (Junior and Seniors) and an under representation of under classmen (Freshmen and Sophomores). In the second part of the Player Defensive Analysis, we perform a similar analysis, but instead of comparing across the players’ class levels, we instead compare by the players’ basketball position (G: Guard, F: Forward, and C: Center). The players’ position is an important root of analysis because it tends to reflect how a player behaves in a team’s overall strategy. On average, guards tend to be the faster, more agile players who handle the basketball and guard the quicker players. Centers tend to be the taller players who tend to stay near the basket to focus on rebounds or, when on defense, to prevent other players trying to score easy points close to the basket (aka block attempts). Forwards, on average, tend to be players that reside between the middle of a guard or center. We first observe that the most efficient rebounding and blocking players tend to be Centers or Forwards; the majority of players with more than 6 Rebounds per Game or more than 1 Block per Game fall into this category. However, we are very surprised by the representation of guards in these two graphs, as this represents that a large number of guards are represented in the top ranked players in these statistics, rather than it being all forwards or centers. Furthermore, we can observe that the majority of efficient Steal players are Guards; a large majority of players with more than 2 Steals per Game are Guards. It is also interesting to observe the non-representation of Centers in this graph. This does make sense, however, since in order to obtain a Steal, the player must be guarding the opposing player who has possession of the basketball and, since guards and forwards defend against the person with possession of the basketball the most frequently given their more agile attributes qualifying them for their position, this trend is quite easy to make sense of. 4.2.2 Team Defensive Analysis The Team Defensive Analysis focuses on an analysis of the teams Steals or Blocks per Game in comparison to a teams “Win Ratio.” A win ratio is defined as the number of wins a teams has normalized by the number of games a team played in the sport season. So a win ratio of 0.5 indicates that the team won half of the total games it played, or that is a a win-to-loss ratio of 1:1. For the purpose of our analysis, we define a “good” win ratio as being 0.5 or greater, and a “bad” win ratio as being less than 0.5. In these analyses, we will center on how a team’s defensive efficiency, which in this case is determined by a comparison of a teams average defensive statistic compared to a teams average number of fouls, potentially relates to a team’s win ratio. Team efficiency is defined in this manner because, often in basketball, effective defensive strategy involves hedging a line between defensive aggression. If a team plays not aggressive enough in the defensive category, they will likely not gain as many total team fouls but they will also not likely gain a defensive advantage. Inversely, if a team plays more aggressively defensibly, they will likely gain a defensive advantage in the game but they are more likely to accumulate a lot of team fouls. A large number of foul calls can be incredibly disadvantageous since it can lead to players being kicked out of the game (if a player has attained 5 personal fouls) and it can lead to free throw attempts for the opposing team (for each team foul accumulated after 6 total team fouls). Observing this graph, we can discern a slight linear relationship between Steals per Game and Fouls per Game as it relates to a team’s win ratio. Looking at teams with “efficient” steals per game (teams towards the upper left side of the graph), we can see that these teams are a lot more likely to have a “good” win ratio. Similarly, looking at teams with “inefficient” steals per game (teams towards the lower right side of the graph), we can see that these teams are a lot more likely to have a “bad” win ratio. It is important to note, however, that these observations hold strongest at the extremes and are quite convoluted outside that. Starting our analysis of the Blocks per Game vs Win Ratio colored by a team’s win ratio, we can observe a very similar trend to the previous graph. When looking at the extremes, teams with “efficient” blocks per game, on average, have a “good” ratio and, inversely, teams with “inefficient” blocks per game tend to have a “bad” win ratio. Thus, in our analysis of defensive efficiency, it is very likely that efficient defensive ability by a basketball team has an impact on a teams success in the NCAA Mens D1 league. However, this holds true most strongly for teams with very efficient or very inefficient ability, as in this analysis not much can be determined for those that do not lie in these extremes. 4.3 Offensive Analysis We defined “Offensive Statistics” to include Assists per Game, 3-Pt Field Goals Made per Game, Free Throws Made per Game, Field Goals Made per Game, Field Goals Attempted per Game, Points per Game. We use the per Game statistic to normalize these statistics by the total number of games played by a player to avoid skewed values. 4.3.1 Player Offensive Analysis The Player Defensive Analysis focuses on the Players’ offensive statistics by average minutes played, compared by their class level (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) and their Player Position (Guard, Forward, or Center). In particular, we focus our analysis on “efficient outliers” in each respective offensive category as well as overall trends in each category by class level or position. We can observe that the representation of the data when observed from the perspective of Player Class Level and Position resembles a right-skewed normal distribution for Assists and 3-Pt Field Goals. Whereas the distribution for Free Throws per Game represents a normal distribution without a skew, which could be due to players generally having a similar skill level and make percentage when it comes to Free Throws. The other two stats are more in-game dependent with a smaller number of players being skilled in scoring 3-Pt Field Goals and making passes that lead to scoring opportunities. One interesting thing to note here is the slight bi-modality for freshmen. We can also observe that there are no “Center” Player Positions represented in the 3-Pt Field Goals per Game subsection of the dataset. Looking at the scoring statistics per game by the Player Class Level, we can clearly see that the number of freshman is very low and the average minutes played per game is less than 34 minutes. Moreover, the players with the most number of minutes played per game are either Juniors or Seniors, which makes sense given their experience and seniority in the team. The players that we could consider outliers are almost always seniors. Players with high number of field goals made also have a high number of attempts and thereby also have a high number of points per game. Darius McGhee is the standout offensive player averaging 24.6 points per game with 18.33 field goals attempted per game. Given the average number of field goal made by Darius McGhee is 8.36, we can say that this player is scoring a high number of 3-Pt field goals. Another outlier is Peter Kiss, a senior averaging 25.2 points per game while also playing an average of 35.5 minutes per game. His 9.11 field goals made per game from an attempted 20 is more than Darius’s but with more minutes played. Now, looking at the scoring metrics from the the player position point of view, we can identify certain trends. There are only 3 centers that are a part of our offensive analysis. This makes sense because centers are usually the taller players that focus on defense and score primarily off of rebounds won. Guards tend to be the faster, more agile players, therefore they form a bulk of our offensive analysis. These players are focused on attack and scoring for the team. Forwards, tend to be players that reside between the middle of a guard or center so they help out in offense and defense. We can see these patterns in the visual above. Darius McGhee and Peter Kiss are the outliers in this analysis as well because we have only changed the categorization from Class Level to Player Position. Unsurprisingly, both of these players are Guards and so are the other outliers with high offensive statistics. Of the players in question, the highest number of minutes per game is played by players playing as Guards. 4.3.2 Team Offensive Analysis The Team Offensive Analysis focuses on analyzing the teams’ Field Goals conversion to their points per game, and also comparing it with the opposition team’s conversion rate. We additionally add the “Win Ratio” to the backdrop. Further, we look at the number of Field Goals made per game against the number of 3-Pt Field Goals made per game to understand a team’s playing style. From the graph we can clearly see a strong linear relation between Percentage of Field Goals converted and the average number of points a team scores per game. While this is obvious at first, adding the additional statistic of win ratio to this visual splits it into 3 sections. First, teams with high conversion rate and Points per game who have high win ratios as well, these are the strongest teams offensively. Second are the teams on the other side, teams with low conversion rate and thereby low points per game with low win ratios. These are the weaker teams in the division. The third and perhaps the most interesting section in the one in the middle. The teams with a 41-46% conversion rate and an average points per game between 60 and 80 points. There is no clear trend in the win ratio for the teams that fall in this section, this could be due to the defensive strength of the team or the strength of the other teams in the conference. Teams in this section need further analysis. Plotting a teams Field Goal conversion percentage to their opposition separates the strong teams from the weak. It also highlights that teams with high offensive efficiency also have a high win ratio. Now, the analysis is similar to the previous part where the teams can be split into 3 sections. However, in this case the middle section would have fewer teams as there is more separation between the top and the bottom sections. We have looked at teams’ Field Goal conversion rates. Now, looking at the plot between the number of field goals per game and the number of 3-Pt field goals per game lends us insight into the playing style of teams. There are teams with a high number of field goals scored per game but low number of them being 3-Pt field goals. This could suggest that these teams tend to score from within the D or have poor 3-Pt conversion rates. Based on the graph, we can say that teams that have fewer number of field goals per game have fewer 3-Pt field goals per game as well. Since scoring a 3-Pt field goal requires more skill given the distance from the basket, one can assume the teams in this section that also have low win ratios are less skill-ful. For this reason, a team with low number of field goal per game would not have a high number of 3-Pt field goals and we can see this from the upper left corner of the plot. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component The graph below allows the user to observe the numerical statistics for the school selected. For example, clicking the “Columbia” button will render the values for the numerical statistics for Columbia’s men’s basketball team. We have also provided statistics for Kansas, a team within the Big 12 conference, so that the user can compare the statistics between two Ivy League schools and a flagship Big 12 basketball school. (Spoiler, Kansas is much better than us) Note: We spent a lot of time trying to show these visualizations in a spider / radar plot because we thought that would be much more engaging. Unfortunately, we were unable to make it work in our given time frame. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In our project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the NCAA D1 Mens college basketball league. Our analysis included an observation of both team and individual players basketball statistics and we sectioned our or analysis of teams and players from the perspective of offensive and defensive basketball statistics. From our analysis, we were able to conclude very insightful relationships between offensive and defensive statistics as it relates to player / team performances. Our work did have some limitations due to the nature of our data source. Per each individual player statistic, the NCAA Statistics website only provided the top 350 ranked players per the statistic requested as opposed to the every player in the league. Thus, our player data was very incomplete and did not allow for a comparison of individual players across different diverse statistics. In the future, we might imagine extending our analysis past just the scope of D1 Mens college basketball league to include Womens leagues and other divisions, like D2 or D3, which are also available from our data source as well. It would be very interesting to see if the trends we observed differ from those we might observe is these other leagues of interest, since this would suggest that the optimal play styles for each league differ and would allow for research into how they might differ.
